<h1>Tick list with react front end and node.js backend</h1>
<p>This app makes calls to my tickList node api. While that app already had a front end, this was my first time 
linking a back end api with a front end in React.  The app is mostly unstyled, something I may fix later, as the exercise was mostly to see how to link a front end and a back end. </p>
